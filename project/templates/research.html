    <p>The mining and analysis of biomedical images presents potentially enormous opportunities to 
    to provide clinicians with powerful new diagnostic tools and drug developers
    with novel methods to quantify disease progression and response to
    treatment. Leveraging the growing amount of biopsy image data collected in
    clinical trials evaluating new therapies for Inflammatory Bowel Disease, my
    colleagues at Janssen R&D and I developed deep learning models for

    <p>The concurrent increase in available connectome data for model organisms such
    as the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and dramatic growth in the
    availability and power of commodity parallel computing technology raises the
    tantalizing possibility of constructing and testing computational models of
    entire biological brains. Much neuroinformatics research has focused on how
    provide and/or utilize the computational resources necessary to efficiently
    emulate the brain's massively parallel operation. While computational
    efficiency is essential to brain modeling, our current lack of knowledge
    regarding the appropriate computational paradigm to employ makes
    optimization of neural simulator performance premature. Moreover, focusing
    exclusively on computational efficiency overlooks other requirements that
    are as least as important to developing a successful brain model.</p>

    <p>Although far more tractable than the human brain, the complexity of the
    brain of the fruit fly is such that effectively combining the efforts of
    multiple researchers is essential to the successful reverse engineering of
    the fly brain. The multiplicity of neural simulators and modeling tools
    currently available complicates collaborative model construction because of
    the difficulty of combining models of different parts of the fly brain
    devised by different researchers. The inability to easily combine hypotheses
    regarding the information processing capabilities of different parts of the
    brain prevents the neuroscience community from pursuing an effective
    divide-and-conquer strategy to reverse engineering the fly brain's
    functions.</p>
    
    <p>To address the above requirements, I developed an open software platform for
    collaborative construction and execution of models of the brain of the fruit
    fly<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>.
    This system is called <b>Neurokernel</b> because it serves as an operating 
    system <i>kernel</i> 
    vis-a-vis models of the fly brain of the fruit fly; just as a traditional
    computer operating system must be able to<i>allocate computational
        resources</i> and serve as an <i>extended machine</i> that provides
    services required by software applications, so too must Neurokernel be able
    to allocate parallel computational resources and provide the programmability
    (e.g., software interfaces, data transmission services, 
    numerical models of constituent neural components, etc.) required to realize
    models of the fly brain. To explicitly facilitate collaborative 
    development of an accurate fly brain model, Neurokernel</p> 
    <ul>
        <li>provides an explicitly open framework for interconnection and
        parallel execution of independently developed models of different
        functional modules called <i>Local Processing Units</i> in the fly brain;</li>
        <li>is implemented in Python, a high-level language that has enjoyed
        increasing popularity in the computational neuroscience community;
        and</li>
        <li>leverages commodity parallel computing technology found in 
        Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to empower as many researchers as 
        possible to contribute to the modeling
        of the fruit fly brain.</li>
    </ul>
